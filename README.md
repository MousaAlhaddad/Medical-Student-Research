# Medical-Student-Research

I am conducting a research on Medical Student Research Productivity. The different scripts that I used to analyze the collected research data are included here. This is an ongoing project, and the research was not published yet. The raw data will not be available at this time in the repository.



## Data Analysis
- Table 1 (PubMed data): showing the counts of the included publications, the counts of the publishing journals, the counts of publications on each research type, the means ± standard deviations of number of authors per publication and students per publication as well as the percentages of first-author student publications and publications solely by students. 
- Table 2: showing the geographical distribution of medical student's research productively by area (e.g. Middle East and North America).
- Table 3 (Web of Science data): showing the means ± standard deviations of the impact factor with and without self-citations, the five years impact factor and citation and classifying publications depending on impact factors to articles published on journals with no impact factor, with an impact factor of less than 1, or an impact factor of more than 1 and depending on citations to cited articles or non-cited articles. 
- Figure 3: showing the changes in the counts of authors per publication and students per publication over the years.
- Figure 4: showing the counts of each country' portion in medical students' research productivity.
